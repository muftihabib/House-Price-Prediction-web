# House-Price-Prediction-web
Welcome to the final and most exciting part of our project series! You have successfully prepared the data, and now it's time to bring it all to life. In this project, you will build the "brain" of our application-the Machine Learning model-and connect it to a web interface that can serve real-time predictions.
